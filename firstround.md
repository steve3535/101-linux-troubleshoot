## Linux
1. I have evidence of recurring execution of a job but couldn't find the corresponding cron.  
   * how do we pull with certainty all cron jobs on a system ?  
   * what of a scenario with remote scheduled cron ?  
   * Think of some users that are service accounts with home directory not in /home  
   * Think of checking the logs of the cron system
